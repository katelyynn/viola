# Simple Dark Resourcepack for Minecraft 1.8-1.18

Simple Dark is the successor to my previous dark-themed resource pack, Metro Dark Theme. This pack is built from the ground up with a sleek and modern design whilst keeping the dark aesthetic. Every GUI in the base game is themed along with most of the Realms GUIs making the experience seamless. The pack also supports some Fabric and Forge mods which can be found over on [plexion.dev](https://l.plexion.dev/simpledark#featuring)

## Installation & Setup

As with any other resourcepack, there is an incredibly simple installation process:

1. Download the resourcepack .zip file and save it somewhere
2. In Minecraft, press `Options...` and then `Resource Packs...`
3. Drag the file you saved earlier into this window and press `Yes`
4. Then click the `>` arrow to enable the pack and hit `Done`
